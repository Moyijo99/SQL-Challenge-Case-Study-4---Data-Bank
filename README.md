Business Case
In the evolving financial industry, a new innovation known as Neo-Banks has emerged. These are digital-only banks without physical branches.

Danny envisioned a synergy between these modern banks, cryptocurrency, and the data sector, thus initiating a new venture - Data Bank!

Data Bank operates like any other digital bank but with a unique twist: it also serves as the worldâ€™s most secure distributed data storage platform. Customers are given cloud data storage limits directly tied to their account balances. This business model has some unique aspects, and the Data Bank team seeks your expertise!

The management team at Data Bank aims to expand their customer base while effectively tracking and predicting the data storage needs of their customers. This case study focuses on calculating metrics, understanding growth, and enabling the business to analyze their data intelligently to forecast and plan for future growth.
